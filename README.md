# Carrier Integration Sandbox

A simplified simulation of a carrier integration system.

## What this project demonstrates

- Canonical shipment event model
- Booking simulation API
- Webhook ingestion
- State machine transitions
- Validation rules (idempotency, ordering, forbidden transitions)

## Why

Built to showcase integration experience in logistics / TMS environments.

## Structure

- docs/ → schemas, BPMN, diagrams
- src/ → API + state machine
- tests/ → validation + flow tests
